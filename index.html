<p class="upperText">Meet Courage, a little purple dog with a heart of gold. He lives with on a farm with Muriel and her cantankerous husband, Eustace.</p>
<p class="upperText">One day, there is a knock on the door. It's a chihuahua named Shirley, and she is asking for "small change to help a poor soul".</p>

<p class="lower_text">Muriel gives Shirley some change, a pie, and a cup of tea. Courage gives her a gold tooth. But Eustace, mean as ever, slams the door in her face.</p>

<p class="lower_text">To teach him a lesson, Shirley uses her saxophone to put a curse on him: </p> 

<p class="lower_text"> Upon your shiny head, a curse. <br>

Long as your soul lives in your purse.<br>  

And with your coins you cannot part.<br>

Your sky shall be dark as your heart. </p>

<p class="lower_text">But Eustace doesn't believe in curses, even as a raincloud follows him constantly. As the curse gets worse, Eustace becomes paranoid. Like always, it is up to Courage to save the day.</p> 

<img img src="Assets/Eustace and his Cloud in the Kitchen.png" alt="Courage the Cowardly Dog" height="259" width="300" class="lower_image">

<p class="lower_text">Shirley sells him a mirror and tells him that Eustace will only break the curse and if sees himself the way he really is and finds generosity in his heart.</p> 

<img img src="Assets/Eustace in the Mirror.png" alt="Courage the Cowardly Dog" height="227" width="300" class="lower_image">

<p class="lower_text">Courage finds Eustace crazed and force-feeding mushrooms to Muriel on the roof of their house. When Courage holds the mirror up, Eustace sees himself as a sad little boy. Eustace gives the little boy a hat. Eustace has finally given of himself. The curse is lifted. And then it comes back the next day when Eustace snatches his hat off of Courage's head.</p>
